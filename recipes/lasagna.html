<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
    <li>1 small Onion (finely diced)</li>
    <li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon Garlic Powder (or 5 garlic cloves, finely minced)</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon Salt</li>    
    <li>½ teaspoon Pepper</li>
    <li>32-40 ounce jar Marinara Sauce (may use more depending on how "saucy" you want it)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parmesan Ricotta Cheese Filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>1 large Egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Dried Basil</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon Salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon Pepper</li>  
    <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
    <li>4 cups Mozzarella Cheese (may use more if you want it extra cheesy)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer.</li>
</ol>    
    <h4>Parmesan Ricotta Cheese Filling:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with ¼ cup of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Place 3 noodles in a single layers on top of the sauce.  Spread each noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and meat sauce.  Repeat.</li>
    <li>Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil.</li>
    <li>Continue to bake until the cheese if bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Cool the lasagna for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces.</li>
